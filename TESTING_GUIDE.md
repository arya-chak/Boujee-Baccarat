### ‚úÖ Test 5: Game Rules - Naturals

- [ ] When Natural appears, hand should have exactly 2 cards
- [ ] Natural should be 8 or 9

### ‚úÖ Test 6: Game Rules - Third Card Drawing

**Banker Draws:**
- [ ] If Player stands, Banker draws on 0-5

- [ ] Bet $10 on Player
- [ ] Bet $10 on Banker
- [ ] Bet $10 on Tie
- [ ] Click DEAL
- [ ] Total wagered: $30
- [ ] Check payouts match winning bet(s)

### ‚úÖ Test 8: Statistics Tracking
- [ ] Play 10 hands
- [ ] Check "Games Played" = 10
- [ ] Check "Win Rate" updates (Player wins only)
- [ ] Check "Net Profit" (green if positive, red if negative)
- [ ] Win/lose intentionally to test calculation

### ‚úÖ Test 9: Game History
**In Browser Console:**
```javascript
// View history
const history = playerStore.getState().history
console.table(history)

// Check first entry
history[0]  // Should show: timestamp, result, bets, netProfit
```
- [ ] History stores up to 50 hands
- [ ] Each entry has timestamp
- [ ] Each entry shows cards, outcome, bets, profit

### ‚úÖ Test 10: Shoe Management
**In Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Check shoe position
const state = gameStore.getState()
console.log('Position:', state.dealerPosition)
console.log('Cut card:', state.cutCardPosition)
console.log('Cards remaining:', state.shoe.length - state.dealerPosition)
```
- [ ] Shoe starts with 416 cards (8 decks √ó 52)
- [ ] Cut card at position ~402 (416 - 14)
- [ ] Position increases by 4-6 per hand
- [ ] When position reaches cut card, shoe reshuffles

### ‚úÖ Test 11: Repeat Last Bet
**Note: Feature exists but UI button not added yet**
```javascript
// In console after a hand
playerStore.getState().repeatLastBets()
```
- [ ] Should place same bets as previous hand
- [ ] Only works if balance is sufficient

### ‚úÖ Test 12: Balance Persistence
- [ ] Play a few hands
- [ ] Note your balance
- [ ] Refresh the page (F5)
- [ ] Balance should be the same
- [ ] History should persist
- [ ] Statistics should persist

### ‚úÖ Test 13: 24-Hour Reset
**In Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Manually trigger reset (for testing)
playerStore.getState().resetBalance()
```
- [ ] Balance resets to $1000
- [ ] lastResetTime updates

### ‚úÖ Test 14: Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to bet with $0 balance - should prevent
- [ ] Try to bet below minimum ($10) - N/A (button is $10)
- [ ] Try to deal without bets - button should be disabled
- [ ] Click DEAL multiple times rapidly - should not double-deal

### ‚úÖ Test 15: Card Display
- [ ] Hearts and Diamonds show ‚ô• and ‚ô¶
- [ ] Clubs and Spades show ‚ô£ and ‚ô†
- [ ] Face cards show J, Q, K
- [ ] Aces show A
- [ ] Number cards show 2-10

## üêõ Common Issues to Check

### Issue: Cards don't appear
- **Check console for errors**
- **Verify:** `gameStore.getState().shoe.length > 0`

### Issue: Balance doesn't update
- **Check:** `playerStore.getState().balance`
- **Check console for errors in processPayout**

### Issue: Wrong payout amounts
- **Formula:** Payout = bet + (bet √ó rate)
- **Player:** bet √ó 2.0 total (1:1)
- **Banker:** bet √ó 1.95 total (0.95:1)
- **Tie:** bet √ó 9.0 total (8:1)

### Issue: Game freezes
- **Check:** `gameStore.getState().phase`
- **Should cycle:** BETTING ‚Üí DEALING ‚Üí RESULT ‚Üí back to BETTING
- **If stuck:** Refresh page

## üéØ Expected Probabilities (Long-Term)

After playing 100+ hands, you should see approximately:
- **Banker wins:** ~45-48% of hands
- **Player wins:** ~44-46% of hands
- **Ties:** ~9-10% of hands

If you always bet Banker, you should be slightly ahead due to Banker's advantage (even with commission).

## üîç Advanced Testing

### Test Hand Calculation
```javascript
// In console
import { calculateHandValue } from '@/game/hand'

// Should return 9
calculateHandValue([{value: 7}, {value: 2}])

// Should return 5 (15 % 10)
calculateHandValue([{value: 9}, {value: 6}])
```

### Test Drawing Rules
```javascript
// Check if Player should draw on 5
import { playerShouldDraw } from '@/game/rules'
// Returns true for 0-5, false for 6-7
```

### Force Specific Outcomes (For Development)
This requires modifying the shoe, but you can test:
```javascript
// Place known cards at the top of the shoe
const store = gameStore.getState()
// Manually manipulate store.shoe if needed for testing
```

## ‚ú® What's Working Perfectly
